# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise is back after her mostly successful campaign for additional information.  (See first README file for Module 1 work.)  

### Purpose
She would like information on Outcomes as related to initial Goals as well as Outcomes Based on Launch Date. (which was included in her first discussion with us, but the first README file was not a Deliverable.  Portions have been duplicated here.)

## Analysis and Challenges
Challenges were looking at data that excluded outliers and interpreting zero results.  It was also challenging to edit numerous formulas.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
(copied from original README.md file created while working through Module 1)
Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing endeavor. Successful campaigns meet or exceed their goals and receive the amount of money pledged. By definition, a failed project is one that doesn't meet its goal, and is therefore unfunded at any amount. Those that pledged to an unsuccessful campaign, do not get charged, and the campaign receives nothing.

Zero counts were returned for all Canceled Theater projects at all Goal levels, thus we focused solely on Successful and Failed Theater campaigns.  Based on our line graph, May is the best time of year to start a successful campaign. Kickstarter's own recommendation for all campaigns is for a duration of 30 days. (https://help.kickstarter.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005128434-What-is-the-maximum-project-duration-) so running a campaign from May 1 - June 1 or May 15 - June 15 would be advised.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on the chart generated of Outcomes based on Goal, it is clear that the successful campaigns are nearly the mirror image of the failed campaigns.  As such, it is not advised to set a goal greater than $5K, which is also confirmed in the first README file presented here, also.  There is more detail in that file containing Box and Whisker charts and an explanation of removing outliers.  Also addressed is Louise's interest in musicals in Great Britain.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Louise requested information previously and the purpose of the two README files have been somewhat confused.  The first README file contains much of the same information as was determined for her second README-kickstarter-challenge file.  The major difficulties encountered were with outliers and determining that Louise's goals may have been initially set too high.  

## Results

*The graph of Outcomes based on Launch Date allows us to conclude that May is the best time of year for a successful theater/plays campaign.  It is also the "best" time for a failed campaign.  So, it isn't enough to just select May in order for the campaign to be successful.

*The graph of Outcomes based on Goals allows us to conclude that Louise's initial goal of $10K was probably too high.  The graph shows that up to about $5K Goals are much more successfully met.  After $5K through $15K the success rates fall and from $15K-$45K are as likely to fail as to succeed in a very unpredictable way, but after $45K almost all Goals are doomed to failure.

This dataset was limited by containing no information on the cause of cancelations or predicted length of live fundraisers.  Duration of fundraiser was not considered, but Kickstarter only allows 60 days and 30 days is recommended.

Other charts that could be looked at were those in the first README file prepared for Louise, which included Box and Whisker plots, with outliers removed, to show the data distributions for plays in the US and musicals in GB.  These charts agree with the Outcome vs Goal that Louise's goals were set too high for likely success.
